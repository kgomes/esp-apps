This directory contains the JSON documents that are the 'views' in the CouchDB for the ESP that
are necessary for the application to operate correctly.

In addition, here are a couple of helpful hints in dealing with CouchDB documents.  When the documents get very
large, it is often times not possible to work with them in the Futon web interface.  When that happens, you will
want to download the documents using curl, edit them and then re-post them to update them.  Here is an example:

curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5984/esp/eb07aed2d84ab91672c105a6b2001897 > neo.json

This command pulls down a CouchDB document from the localhost server, from the 'esp' database with a document
ID of eb07aed2d84ab91672c105a6b2001897.  We then redirect that output to a JSON file so we can edit it.  Once
the editing has been done, you can push the update using:

curl -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d @neo.json -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:5984/esp/eb07aed2d84ab91672c105a6b2001897

which will update the document on the server (assuming it has not changed since you downloaded it).

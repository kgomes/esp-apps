This directory contains a couple files that are config files for CouchDB.  They are used if you are running CouchDB using the docker-compose.yml file in the top level directory of this project.  The idea is you would take these two files (local.ini and default.ini) and copy and paste them into a directory where they would then be mounted into the CouchDB docker container (see top level README.md for more instructions).  You can then edit those .ini files to customize how CouchDB runs.
